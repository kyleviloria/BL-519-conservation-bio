WARNING!

&lt;/SPAN&gt;You should read carefully all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, as defined below, between 4D SAS, a French "Société par Actions Simplifiée" (hereinafter referred to as "4D") and yourself (hereinafter referred to as "LICENSEE"). By pressing on the button "Accept", you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, please, if applicable, immediately return the media containing the Software along with the Documentation, the package and a copy of the corresponding sales receipt to the location where you acquired your license of use or your evaluation license or to the address mentioned in the Documentation to obtain full refund. 

This Agreement defines the terms and conditions of the license of use and related Maintenance, as well as the evaluation license related to the Software as defined below. The specific provisions hereinafter that will apply to one of the two types of licenses will be clearly distinguished as such.

This license only extends to the Software for which LICENSEE has regularly purchased a license and received the authorized product number, subject to the methods defined in the Documentation.

4D is willing to grant LICENSEE a license of use or an evaluation license only under the condition that LICENSEE accepts all the terms contained in this Agreement that are appropriate to each type of license and to each type of Software.

The following words have a specific significance:

“4D Application” means a computer program developed with the Software.

“4D Application Single User” means a 4D Application which can be installed and used on a stand-alone computer and by a single user exclusively; it being agreed that except as provided otherwise, such 4D Application Single User may not be used as a server (data server) or as a client which allows an access to data from another computer and/or to another computer.

“Agreement” means this agreement and any amendment thereof.

“Authorized number of Concurrent Users” means the maximum number of simultaneously connected users to the Software who are authorized by 4D at a given point in time and for which 4D has received appropriate license fees from LICENSEE.

“Documentation” means all the electronic documentation files and/or the documentation contained in or on the related Media and/or the Software user's manual.

“Environment” means the computer hardware, operating system(s) ("platform(s)") and the software required for use in conjunction with the Software, and indicated on the Media, it being agreed that each license is only granted for one (1) Environment.

“Instance” means the combination of a 4D Application and a data file.

“Maintenance” means the information relating to the availability of Updates and upon LICENSEE’s request, the provision of such Updates for the Environment, subject to the payment of the corresponding yearly fee and the compliance with the terms of the Agreement. 

“Media” means all methods through which LICENSEE obtained the Software, which includes a DVD-ROM and its package, or any type of media, and notably the 4D's web sites and/or 4D's Ftp site.

“Server Computer” means the computer used as a server. 

“Software” means 4D's computer program(s) in machine-readable executable code form and copies made of it, including related Documentation, any replacement or change and/or any Update provided under the Agreement.

“Updates” means the maintenance versions and/or minor and/or major updates, it being understood that any Software is designated by two (2) numbers: “X” defines the number of major update and “Y”, the number of minor update.

In case of early termination of the Maintenance or more generally the Agreement for any reason and except as expressly otherwise stated in this Agreement, LICENSEE agrees that the fees paid for the corresponding license and - if applicable - Maintenance, are not refundable and that such termination shall not relieve LICENSEE from paying any amount due at the date of the termination pursuant to this Agreement.

LICENSEE shall stop using the Software, destroy or return the Software and the Documentation and any copy made whether partial or whole, and return the product number to 4D.

LICENSEE shall certify by means of a written document duly signed by a legal representative that the provisions of the present section have been respected within a time limit of five (5) days from the date of termination.

If the audit reveals a non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and/or a discrepancy with the information given by LICENSEE, LICENSEE shall pay all 4D’s reasonable costs relating to the audit and this, without damage to other rights and 4D’s recourse.

This provision shall remain in force two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement for any reason whatsoever.


&lt;SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold"&gt;9. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
&lt;/SPAN&gt;

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable upon a definite legal or reglementary provision or a statutory or judicial determination, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

The waiver by 4D of one breach or default hereunder does not constitute the waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
